# 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide - Voice Assistant Issues

## ✅ **Fixed Issues**

### 1. **Connection Error / Streamlit Disconnection**
**Problem**: "Connection error - Is Streamlit still running?" appears during continuous chat.

**Root Cause**: Excessive `st.rerun()` calls were causing Streamlit to restart too frequently.

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Reduced frequency of `st.rerun()` calls
- ✅ Added connection stability monitoring
- ✅ Implemented manual "Listen for Next Message" mode (recommended)
- ✅ Added experimental auto-listen mode with safeguards

### 2. **Disappearing Text Responses**
**Problem**: AI responses appear briefly then disappear.

**Root Cause**: Auto-refresh was clearing the conversation display.

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Created persistent conversation container
- ✅ Shows last 10 conversation exchanges with timestamps
- ✅ Numbered conversation history for easy tracking

### 3. **Inconsistent Voice Responses**
**Problem**: Voice responses work sometimes but not always.

**Root Cause**: TTS conflicts and error handling issues.

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Improved error handling for TTS
- ✅ Added voice response status indicators
- ✅ Better separation between voice and text modes

## 🎯 **Current Voice Chat Modes**

### **Recommended: Manual Continuous Chat**
- ✅ **Most Stable**: Click "Listen for Next Message" after each response
- ✅ **Persistent Display**: Conversation history stays visible
- ✅ **Reliable Voice**: Consistent voice responses
- ✅ **No Connection Issues**: Doesn't cause Streamlit disconnections

### **Experimental: Auto-Listen Mode**
- ⚠️ **Use with Caution**: May cause connection issues

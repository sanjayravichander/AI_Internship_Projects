## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Speech Recognition**:

audio = recognizer.listen(source, timeout=10, phrase_time_limit=15)

# Better error handling
except sr.WaitTimeoutError:
    return "No speech detected. Please try again."
except sr.UnknownValueError:
    return "Could not understand audio. Please speak clearly."
```

### **TTS Reliability**:
```python
def speak(text, emotion="neutral"):
    # Method 1: pyttsx3 with emotion
    # Method 2: Windows SAPI fallback  
    # Method 3: Text-only fallback
    # All with comprehensive error handling
```

### **Greeting System**:
```python
def greet_user(user_name, assistant_name):
    # Time-appropriate greeting
    # Personalized message
    # Voice output with emotion
```

### **Session State**:
```python
# Enhanced state management
if "greeted" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["greeted"] = False

# Name change detection
if st.session_state["last_user_name"] != user_name:
    st.session_state["greeted"] = False  # Trigger new greeting
```

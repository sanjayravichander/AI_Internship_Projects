## ‚ú® Features

  * **Dual Quiz Modes:** Choose between **LLM Generated Quizzes** on any topic or **Upload CSV File** to use your own custom question sets.
  * **Dynamic Question Generation:** Utilizes the **Groq API** and a `gemma2-9b-it` LLM to create unique, multiple-choice questions in real-time.
  * **Difficulty Levels:** Select `Beginner`, `Intermediate`, or `Advanced` difficulty for LLM-generated quizzes. CSV uploads can also leverage difficulty levels if present.
  * **Smart CSV Handling:**
      * **Flexible Column Detection:** Automatically maps common column names (e.g., `question`, `answer`, `a`, `optiona`, `explanation`, `difficulty`).
      * **Boolean Question Support:** Intelligently identifies and formats True/False questions from CSVs.
      * **Difficulty Mapping:** Converts various difficulty aliases (e.g., "easy", "hard", "1", "L3") into standardized levels.
      * **Explanation Generation:** Automatically generates explanations for CSV questions if none are provided.
      * **Question Uniqueness:** Filters out previously used questions from CSVs to ensure fresh quizzes.
  * **Interactive User Interface:** Clear and intuitive Streamlit UI for seamless quiz progression.
  * **Score Tracking & Results Summary:** View your score, percentage, and receive performance feedback at the end of each quiz.
  * **Detailed Question Review:** Expandable sections for each question in the results, showing your answer, the correct answer, and a comprehensive explanation.
  * **Downloadable Results:** Export your quiz results to a CSV file for review or record-keeping.
  * **Session Management:** Intelligent handling of Streamlit session state to maintain quiz progress and avoid question repetition across restarts.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to get your AI Quiz Game up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * **Python 3.8+**
  * **Groq API Key:** You'll need an API key from [Groq Cloud](https://console.groq.com/keys).

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository (or create the files):**
    If you have a Git repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```

    Otherwise, save the provided code as `quiz_app.py` and create the following files/folders.

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment:

      * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
      * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project root with the following content:

    ```
    streamlit
    pandas
    python-dotenv
    langchain-groq
    langchain-core
    ```

    Then, install them:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Your Groq API Key:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory (the same directory as `quiz_app.py`).
    Add your Groq API key to this file:

    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

    Replace `"YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key from Groq Cloud.

5.  **Run the Streamlit App:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run quiz_app.py
    ```

    Your browser should automatically open to the Streamlit application (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## üìÅ CSV File Format for Uploads

If you choose the "Upload CSV File" mode, your CSV should ideally contain the following columns (column names are flexible due to the intelligent mapping):
